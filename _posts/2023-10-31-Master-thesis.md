I'm currently in my final year as a Data Science student at UCLouvain, and I have the fantastic chance to dedicate my master's thesis to the topic of "KernelICA for Identification Problems in SVAR Models." It's a thrilling subject, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the research and work involved. I'm optimistic about doing well and making the most of this opportunity.
