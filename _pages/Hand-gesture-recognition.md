## Gesture Recognition Project - LINFO2275 Data Mining and Decision Making

### Overview
In an academic collaboration for the course **LINFO2275 - Data Mining and Decision Making** at UCLouvain, my colleagues Chlo√© Marchal, Mathieu Graf and I embarked on a challenging and insightful journey into the world of gesture recognition. Our project's aim was to develop a smart user interface capable of recognizing hand gestures with high accuracy. We explored and implemented two distinct methodologies: the traditional edit-distance approach and the more contemporary convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

### Project Highlights
- **Datasets**: Engaged with two public datasets comprising 1000 sequences each, capturing ten subjects drawing ten different objects in 3D space.
- **Preprocessing**: Mastered complex preprocessing techniques tailored to each method, converting raw data into usable formats for machine learning models.
- **Edit-Distance Method**: Delved into the intricacies of dynamic programming to implement the edit-distance algorithm, enhancing it with k-nearest neighbors (knn) classification.
- **CNN Implementation**: Designed and trained a convolutional neural network, adapting its architecture for the task of image-based gesture recognition.
- **Evaluation**: Employed user-dependent and user-independent cross-validation strategies to assess model performance, gaining valuable insights into their applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Learning Outcomes
- **Data Preprocessing**: Acquired proficiency in transforming sequences into standardized formats and visual representations, laying a strong foundation for any machine learning workflow.
- **Algorithmic Understanding**: Gained a deep understanding of the edit-distance algorithm and dynamic programming, recognizing their strengths and limitations in practical applications.
- **Cross-Validation Techniques**: Enhanced my knowledge of model validation, learning how to reliably evaluate model performance and generalize findings beyond the training data.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Learned to critically compare different models, not only in terms of their accuracy but also considering their suitability for different user scenarios.

### Reflection
This project was a testament to the power of data mining and decision-making techniques in creating intelligent systems. Through iterative development and rigorous testing, I have become proficient in recognizing patterns within data, selecting appropriate machine learning models, and tuning them to meet specific performance criteria. The experience has solidified my understanding of the end-to-end process of developing a machine learning project, from conception to evaluation.

As a data science enthusiast, this project has been pivotal in sharpening my technical skills and deepening my appreciation for the field's complexity and potential. It stands as a highlight in my portfolio, showcasing my ability to tackle advanced problems and derive actionable insights through data-driven methodologies.
