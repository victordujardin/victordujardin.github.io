### Project Overview

**Course:** LSTAT2130 - Introduction to Bayesian statistics  
**Submission Date:** May 2023  
**Authors:** Lucas Elvira, Mathieu Graf, Victor Dujardin  
**Guidance:** Professor Philippe Lambert, Teaching Assistant Hortense Doms  

As an integral component of my coursework in Bayesian statistics, this project provided a platform to delve into the application of Bayesian analysis to model the growth patterns of cancer cells. The initiative was not only a testament to my analytical prowess but also served as a conduit for a deeper comprehension of the intricate biological systems.

### Key Objectives
- Employ Bayesian statistical methods to construct a model that accurately represents cancer cell growth.
- Extract and interpret complex biological data using advanced probabilistic models.
- Utilize statistical software to carry out sophisticated data analysis and inference.

### Skills Acquired
- **Statistical Analysis**: Mastery of Bayesian statistics principles, including hypothesis formulation, prior selection, and posterior analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: Acquired the skill to create and validate predictive models for interpreting biological data.
- **Computational Proficiency**: Enhanced use of statistical software tools for executing Bayesian inference.
- **Critical Thinking**: Developed the ability to construct and assess hypotheses based on statistical evidence.
- **Research & Collaboration**: Conducted thorough research and participated in a team to solve complex issues.
- **Communication**: Sharpened skills in communicating complex ideas and findings in a clear and succinct manner.

This endeavor was a cornerstone in my academic journey, blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications in biosciences. It stands as a testament to my capability to address data-driven challenges and derive actionable insights in healthcare and research sectors.
