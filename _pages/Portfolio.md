**Overview**
In the project, my colleague Mathieu Graf and I engaged with advanced statistical concepts and numerical methods to explore and analyze mathematical functions. The project was centered around the function f(x) = exp(x)/(1+exp(x)), for which we developed a third-order Taylor expansion and applied Newton's method to find its maximum.

**Objectives**
The primary objectives of the project were to:
- Derive the Taylor series expansion for a given function and understand the approximation of functions around a point.
- Implement Newton's method to optimize functions, specifically to find the maximum of the targeted function.
- Employ R programming skills to perform mathematical computations and generate relevant visualizations.

**Learning Outcomes**
Through the completion of this project, I have gained valuable insights and deepened my understanding of several key areas:
- **Mathematical Proficiency**: Enhanced my grasp of Taylor series and their practical applications in approximating complex functions.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Developed a clear understanding of iterative methods like Newton's method for root-finding and optimization problems.
- **Computational Skills**: Solidified my R programming capabilities, including writing functions, controlling flow, and utilizing packages for numerical analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Improved my ability to visualize mathematical concepts and results using R's plotting capabilities, which is crucial for data analysis and interpretation.
- **Problem-Solving**: Strengthened my problem-solving skills by translating mathematical theory into practical algorithms and code.

**Conclusion**
"Project LSTAT2185" was a comprehensive exercise in applying numerical methods to real-world statistical problems. The successful implementation of the Taylor expansion and Newton's method not only served to confirm theoretical knowledge but also to refine programming skills in R that are widely applicable in data science and analytics roles. This project stands as a testament to my analytical thinking and my ability to harness computational tools to drive decision-making and problem-solving in the field of statistics.




### Asteroid Classification Using SVM and Kernel SVMs

In collaboration with Mathieu Graf, this machine learning project aimed to classify asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous by employing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and kernel SVMs. This initiative was a deep dive into SVM analysis, enhancing our understanding of kernel functions and their impact on classification tasks.

**Project Overview**

Leveraging a dataset from NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), we scrutinized 4687 observations, each detailing the physical and orbital properties of asteroids. Our goal was to create a predictive model to determine the potential hazard of an asteroid based on these characteristics.

**Methodological Approach**

Our approach began with analyzing the data linearity using a linear SVM, followed by applying non-linear SVMs. Through extensive cross-validation, we optimized the model parameters, focusing on the number of support vectors, the objective function's value, and the accuracy of classifications. Data visualization techniques, such as principal component analysis, were pivotal in interpreting the outcomes.

**Innovative Explorations**

A significant portion of our research was dedicated to experimenting with different kernel functions, including linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels. The Laplacian kernel was particularly notable for its robustness against outliers and noise, which was evident in our model with a gamma value of 1.

**Key Learnings**

The project accentuated the criticality of choosing the right kernel functions and the delicate balance needed in parameter tuning. The performance metrics provided insights into the capabilities and limitations of SVMs and kernel SVMs in classification tasks.

Working with Mathieu Graf on this project was a demonstration of our combined technical expertise and collaborative synergy. It was an invaluable experience that refined our analytical skills and enhanced our data science proficiency for future endeavors.
