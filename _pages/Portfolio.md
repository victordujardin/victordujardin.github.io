**Innovative Explorations**

A significant portion of our research was dedicated to experimenting with different kernel functions, including linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels. The Laplacian kernel was particularly notable for its robustness against outliers and noise, which was evident in our model with a gamma value of 1.

**Key Learnings**

The project accentuated the criticality of choosing the right kernel functions and the delicate balance needed in parameter tuning. The performance metrics provided insights into the capabilities and limitations of SVMs and kernel SVMs in classification tasks.

Working with Mathieu Graf on this project was a demonstration of our combined technical expertise and collaborative synergy. It was an invaluable experience that refined our analytical skills and enhanced our data science proficiency for future endeavors.
